Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: _Kazuki Pickersgill_

This repo contains starter files:  

- `assignment1.py` is the file you must write your assignment code in.
- `movies.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
- `movies_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used in your program... This is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it again.
- `README.md` is the file you're reading. You must edit this to answer the questions below.


1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?

    10 hours

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

    Pay more attention to the example output code, I ended up spending unnecessary time fixing or reformatting my code to match the assignment example out/layout
